# DSA Java Solutions

This repository contains my Java solutions to common data structures and algorithm problems. Structured by topic for easy reference.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming

## Running the Code

Each file contains a `main()` method for testing purposes. You can run any Java file independently using:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName


---

### âœ… Tips:

- Stick to a naming convention, e.g. `CamelCase.java` for classes.
- Add comments to explain the logic.
- Include time and space complexity in each file.
- Optionally, create test cases using `JUnit` later.
- You can also add a `leetcode/`, `gfg/`, or `interviewbit/` folder if you're practicing on those platforms.
